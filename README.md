# Your-Location
APPTITUDE hack
This app is made by Panshul Jindal and Shamith Rao. We both started Android App Development just few months back and were 
excited to learn as this was the first domain in computer science which we were learning. This is a app called Your Location. 
So the basic feature of this app is that the users can fetch their current location and then they can display it on the maps. 
The problem statement which was given to us was to Fetch the current location and display it.We think that we completed the easy 
problem statement which was assigned to us. We have learn't alot throughout this hackathon and really thank ACM - VIT in organizing such 
a wonderly hackathon which gave people like us a chance to increase their knowledge in the respective field. This app contains a loading 
screen which then displays the home page. The home page contains two buttons which help fetch the location and show in map. 
After pressing the fetch the location button for the first the app asks for the permission for accessing the location. After that you
can view the latitude, longitude, country name, locality and the address of your location. And when you press the show in map button 
then you can view the location in the maps.
